Like<br>`assert.string(myArg, "myArg")`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks<br>like this:<br><br>```javascript<br>    var assert = require("assert-plus");<br><br>    function fooAccount(options, callback) {<br>        assert.object(options, "options");<br>        assert.number(options.id, "options.id");<br>        assert.bool(options.isManager, "options.isManager");<br>        assert.string(options.name, "options.name");<br>        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, "options.email");<br>        assert.func(callback, "callback");<br><br>        // Do stuff<br>        callback(null, {});<br>    }<br>```<br><br># API<br><br>All methods that *aren"t* part of node"s core assert API are simply assumed to<br>take an argument, and then a string "name" that"s not a message; `AssertionError`<br>will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:<br><br>    AssertionError: foo (string) is required<br>    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)<br>    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)<br>    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)<br>    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)<br>    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)<br>    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)<br>    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)<br>    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)<br><br>from:<br><br>```javascript<br>    function test(foo) {<br>        assert.string(foo, "foo");<br>    }<br>```<br><br>There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:<br><br>```javascript<br>    function test(foo) {<br>        assert.arrayOfString(foo, "foo");<br>    }<br>```<br><br>You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):<br><br>```javascript<br>    assert.optionalString(foo, "foo");<br>```<br><br>Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the<br>environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have<br>lots of assertions, and don"t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in<br>production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are<br>also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from<br>the `assert` module avoids this behavior.<br><br>The complete list of APIs is:<br><br>* assert.array<br>* assert.bool<br>* assert.buffer<br>* assert.func<br>* assert.number<br>* assert.finite<br>* assert.object<br>* assert.string<br>* assert.stream<br>* assert.date<br>* assert.regexp<br>* assert.uuid<br>* assert.arrayOfArray<br>* assert.arrayOfBool<br>* assert.arrayOfBuffer<br>* assert.arrayOfFunc<br>* assert.arrayOfNumber<br>* assert.arrayOfFinite<br>* assert.arrayOfObject<br>* assert.arrayOfString<br>* assert.arrayOfStream<br>* assert.arrayOfDate<br>* assert.arrayOfRegexp<br>* assert.arrayOfUuid<br>* assert.optionalArray<br>* assert.optionalBool<br>* assert.optionalBuffer<br>* assert.optionalFunc<br>* assert.optionalNumber<br>* assert.optionalFinite<br>* assert.optionalObject<br>* assert.optionalString<br>* assert.optionalStream<br>* assert.optionalDate<br>* assert.optionalRegexp<br>* assert.optionalUuid<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfArray<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfBool<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfObject<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfString<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfStream<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfDate<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp<br>* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid<br>* assert.AssertionError<br>* assert.fail<br>* assert.ok<br>* assert.equal<br>* assert.notEqual<br>* assert.deepEqual<br>* assert.notDeepEqual<br>* assert.strictEqual<br>* assert.notStrictEqual<br>* assert.throws<br>* assert.doesNotThrow<br>* assert.ifError<br><br># Installation<br><br>    npm install assert-plus<br><br>## License<br><br>The MIT License (MIT)<br>Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of<br>this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in<br>the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to<br>use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of<br>the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,<br>subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all<br>copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with<br>implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still<br>does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.<br><br>On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which<br>avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate<br>watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been<br>specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much<br>more than needed.<br><br>## Getting started<br>Install with npm:<br><br>```sh<br>npm install chokidar<br>```<br><br>Then `require` and use it in your code:<br><br>```javascript<br>var chokidar = require("chokidar");<br><br>// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles<br>chokidar.watch(".", {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on("all", (event, path) => {<br>  console.log(event, path);<br>});<br>```<br><br>```javascript<br>// Example of a more typical implementation structure:<br><br>// Initialize watcher.<br>var watcher = chokidar.watch("file, dir, glob, or array", {<br>  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,<br>  persistent: true<br>});<br><br>// Something to use when events are received.<br>var log = console.log.bind(console);<br>// Add event listeners.<br>watcher<br>  .on("add", path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))<br>  .on("change", path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))<br>  .on("unlink", path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));<br><br>// More possible events.<br>watcher<br>  .on("addDir", path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))<br>  .on("unlinkDir", path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))<br>  .on("error", error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))<br>  .on("ready", () => log("Initial scan complete.

Paths to files, dirs to be watched<br>recursively, or glob patterns.<br>* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:<br><br>#### Persistence<br><br>* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process<br>should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to<br>`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted<br>after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.<br><br>#### Path filtering<br><br>* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)<br>Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is<br>tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it<br>gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second<br>time with two arguments (the path and the<br>[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)<br>object of that path).<br>* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while<br>instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).<br>* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the<br>symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following<br>the link references and bubbling events through the link"s path.<br>* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be<br>derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.<br>* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as<br>literal path names, even if they look like globs.<br><br>#### Performance<br><br>* `usePolling` (default: `false`).<br>Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling<br>leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is<br>typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over<br>a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other<br>non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the<br>`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable<br>to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.<br>* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)<br>  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also<br>    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.<br>  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system<br>  polling for binary files.<br>  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))<br>* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the<br>`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly<br>and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When<br>set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.<br>* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the<br>[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)<br>object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set<br>this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn"t<br>already available from the underlying watch events.<br>* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of<br>subdirectories will be traversed.<br>* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).<br>By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before<br>the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`<br>events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,<br>especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the<br>write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.<br>Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,<br>holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a<br>configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily<br>dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should<br>be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.<br>Use with caution.<br>  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust<br>  timing params:*<br>  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in<br>  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.<br>  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.<br><br>#### Errors<br>* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files<br>that don"t have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`<br>or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.<br>* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).<br>Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use<br>"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is<br>re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event<br>rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well<br>for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in<br>milliseconds.<br><br>### Methods & Events<br><br>`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:<br><br>* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.<br>Takes an array of strings or just one string.<br>* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.<br>Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,<br>`raw`, `error`.<br>Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event<br>name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.<br>* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.<br>Takes an array of strings or just one string.<br>* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.<br>* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file<br>system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object"s keys are all the<br>directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the<br>values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.<br><br>## CLI<br><br>If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out<br>[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to<br>execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.<br><br>## Install Troubleshooting<br><br>* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`<br>  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is<br>    not indicative of a problem.

The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.<br><br>```js<br>#!/usr/bin/env node<br><br>/**<br> * Module dependencies.<br> */<br><br>var program = require("commander");<br><br>program<br>  .version("0.0.1")<br>  .option("-p, --peppers", "Add peppers")<br>  .option("-P, --pineapple", "Add pineapple")<br>  .option("-b, --bbq", "Add bbq sauce")<br>  .option("-c, --cheese [type]", "Add the specified type of cheese [marble]", "marble")<br>  .parse(process.argv);<br><br>console.log("you ordered a pizza with:");<br>if (program.peppers) console.log("  - peppers");<br>if (program.pineapple) console.log("  - pineapple");<br>if (program.bbq) console.log("  - bbq");<br>console.log("  - %s cheese", program.cheese);<br>```<br><br> Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.<br><br>## Automated --help<br><br> The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:<br><br>```  <br> $ ./examples/pizza --help<br><br>   Usage: pizza [options]<br><br>   Options:<br><br>     -V, --version        output the version number<br>     -p, --peppers        Add peppers<br>     -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple<br>     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce<br>     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]<br>     -h, --help           output usage information<br><br>```<br><br>## Coercion<br><br>```js<br>function range(val) {<br>  return val.split("..").map(Number);<br>}<br><br>function list(val) {<br>  return val.split(",");<br>}<br><br>program<br>  .version("0.0.1")<br>  .usage("[options] <file ...>")<br>  .option("-i, --integer <n>", "An integer argument", parseInt)<br>  .option("-f, --float <n>", "A float argument", parseFloat)<br>  .option("-r, --range <a>..<b>", "A range", range)<br>  .option("-l, --list <items>", "A list", list)<br>  .option("-o, --optional [value]", "An optional value")<br>  .parse(process.argv);<br><br>console.log(" int: %j", program.integer);<br>console.log(" float: %j", program.float);<br>console.log(" optional: %j", program.optional);<br>program.range = program.range || [];<br>console.log(" range: %j..%j", program.range[0], program.range[1]);<br>console.log(" list: %j", program.list);<br>console.log(" args: %j", program.args);<br>```<br><br>## Custom help<br><br> You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information<br> by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically<br> exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program<br> does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example<br> in the following executable "stuff" will not output when<br> `--help` is used.<br><br>```js<br>#!/usr/bin/env node<br><br>/**<br> * Module dependencies.<br> */<br><br>var program = require("../");<br><br>function list(val) {<br>  return val.split(",").map(Number);<br>}<br><br>program<br>  .version("0.0.1")<br>  .option("-f, --foo", "enable some foo")<br>  .option("-b, --bar", "enable some bar")<br>  .option("-B, --baz", "enable some baz");<br><br>// must be before .parse() since<br>// node"s emit() is immediate<br><br>program.on("--help", function(){<br>  console.log("  Examples:");<br>  console.log("");<br>  console.log("    $ custom-help --help");<br>  console.log("    $ custom-help -h");<br>  console.log("");<br>});<br><br>program.parse(process.argv);<br><br>console.log("stuff");<br>```<br><br>yielding the following help output:<br><br>```<br><br>Usage: custom-help [options]<br><br>Options:<br><br>  -h, --help     output usage information<br>  -V, --version  output the version number<br>  -f, --foo      enable some foo<br>  -b, --bar      enable some bar<br>  -B, --baz      enable some baz<br><br>Examples:<br><br>  $ custom-help --help<br>  $ custom-help -h<br><br>```<br><br>## .outputHelp()<br><br>  Output help information without exiting.<br><br>## .help()<br><br>  Output help information and exit immediately.<br><br>## Links<br><br> - [API documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/)<br> - [ascii tables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/cli-table)<br> - [progress bars](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress)<br> - [more progress bars](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter)<br> - [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/tree/master/examples)<br><br>## License <br><br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br>"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br>without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br>distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br>permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br>the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY<br>CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,<br>TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE<br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br>===== component-emitter@1.2.1 =====<br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 Component contributors <dev@component.io><br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person<br>obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation<br>files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without<br>restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,<br>copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the<br>Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following<br>conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES<br>OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND<br>NONINFRINGEMENT.

Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks<br>  on a "submit" button from firing a second time.<br><br>  The debounced function returned has a property "clear" that is a <br>  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.<br><br>  The debounced function returned has a property "flush" that is a <br>  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,<br>  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced<br>  function.<br><br>## License<br><br>  MIT<br><br>  Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)<br>  which also has an MIT license.<br><br>===== debug@2.2.0 =====<br># debug<br><br>  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core"s debugging technique.<br><br>## Installation<br><br>```bash<br>$ npm install debug<br>```<br><br>## Usage<br><br> With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you"re used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.<br><br>Example _app.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug")("http")<br>  , http = require("http")<br>  , name = "My App";<br><br>// fake app<br><br>debug("booting %s", name);<br><br>http.createServer(function(req, res){<br>  debug(req.method + " " + req.url);<br>  res.end("hello\n");<br>}).listen(3000, function(){<br>  debug("listening");<br>});<br><br>// fake worker of some kind<br><br>require("./worker");<br>```<br><br>Example _worker.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug")("worker");<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  debug("doing some work");<br>}, 1000);<br>```<br><br> The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:<br><br>  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)<br><br>  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)<br><br>#### Windows note<br><br> On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.<br><br> ```cmd<br> set DEBUG=*,-not_this<br> ```<br><br>Then, run the program to be debugged as usual.<br><br>## Millisecond diff<br><br>  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.<br><br>  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)<br><br>  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:<br><br>  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)<br><br>## Conventions<br><br> If you"re using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".<br><br>## Wildcards<br><br>  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.<br><br>  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".<br><br>## Browser support<br><br>  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`, and wish to debug both. Somewhere in the code on your page, include:<br><br>```js<br>window.myDebug = require("debug");<br>```<br><br>  ("debug" is a global object in the browser so we give this object a different name.) When your page is open in the browser, type the following in the console:<br><br>```js<br>myDebug.enable("worker:*")<br>```<br><br>  Refresh the page. Debug output will continue to be sent to the console until it is disabled by typing `myDebug.disable()` in the console.<br><br>```js<br>a = debug("worker:a");<br>b = debug("worker:b");<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  a("doing some work");<br>}, 1000);<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  b("doing some work");<br>}, 1200);<br>```<br><br>#### Web Inspector Colors<br><br>  Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the `%c` formatting<br>  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version<br>  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))<br>  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).<br><br>  Colored output looks something like:<br><br>  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)<br><br>### stderr vs stdout<br><br>You can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:<br><br>Example _stdout.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug");<br>var error = debug("app:error");<br><br>// by default stderr is used<br>error("goes to stderr!");<br><br>var log = debug("app:log");<br>// set this namespace to log via console.log<br>log.log = console.log.bind(console); // don"t forget to bind to console!<br>log("goes to stdout");<br>error("still goes to stderr!");<br><br>// set all output to go via console.info<br>// overrides all per-namespace log settings<br>debug.log = console.info.bind(console);<br>error("now goes to stdout via console.info");<br>log("still goes to stdout, but via console.info now");<br>```<br><br>### Save debug output to a file<br><br>You can save all debug statements to a file by piping them.<br><br>Example:<br><br>```bash<br>$ DEBUG_FD=3 node your-app.js 3> whatever.log<br>```<br><br>## Authors<br><br> - TJ Holowaychuk<br> - Nathan Rajlich<br><br>## License<br><br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br>"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br>without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br>distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br>permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br>the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY<br>CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,<br>TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE<br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br>===== debug@2.6.9 =====<br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca><br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software <br>and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, <br>including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, <br>and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,<br>subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial <br>portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT <br>LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. <br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, <br>WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE <br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br><br>===== decode-uri-component@0.2.0 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) Sam Verschueren <sam.verschueren@gmail.com> (github.com/SamVerschueren)<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It runs on both CommonJS runtimes<br>(e.g. [nodejs]) and in a web browser.<br><br>ipaddr.js allows you to verify and parse string representation of an IP<br>address, match it against a CIDR range or range list, determine if it falls<br>into some reserved ranges (examples include loopback and private ranges),<br>and convert between IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.<br><br>[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org<br><br>## Installation<br><br>`npm install ipaddr.js`<br><br>or<br><br>`bower install ipaddr.js`<br><br>## API<br><br>ipaddr.js defines one object in the global scope: `ipaddr`. In CommonJS,<br>it is exported from the module:<br><br>```js<br>var ipaddr = require("ipaddr.js");<br>```<br><br>The API consists of several global methods and two classes: ipaddr.IPv6 and ipaddr.IPv4.<br><br>### Global methods<br><br>There are three global methods defined: `ipaddr.isValid`, `ipaddr.parse` and<br>`ipaddr.process`. All of them receive a string as a single parameter.<br><br>The `ipaddr.isValid` method returns `true` if the address is a valid IPv4 or<br>IPv6 address, and `false` otherwise. It does not throw any exceptions.<br><br>The `ipaddr.parse` method returns an object representing the IP address,<br>or throws an `Error` if the passed string is not a valid representation of an<br>IP address.<br><br>The `ipaddr.process` method works just like the `ipaddr.parse` one, but it<br>automatically converts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses to their IPv4 counterparts<br>before returning. It is useful when you have a Node.js instance listening<br>on an IPv6 socket, and the `net.ivp6.bindv6only` sysctl parameter (or its<br>equivalent on non-Linux OS) is set to 0. In this case, you can accept IPv4<br>connections on your IPv6-only socket, but the remote address will be mangled.<br>Use `ipaddr.process` method to automatically demangle it.<br><br>### Object representation<br><br>Parsing methods return an object which descends from `ipaddr.IPv6` or<br>`ipaddr.IPv4`. These objects share some properties, but most of them differ.<br><br>#### Shared properties<br><br>One can determine the type of address by calling `addr.kind()`. It will return<br>either `"ipv6"` or `"ipv4"`.<br><br>An address can be converted back to its string representation with `addr.toString()`.<br>Note that this method:<br> * does not return the original string used to create the object (in fact, there is<br>   no way of getting that string)<br> * returns a compact representation (when it is applicable)<br><br>A `match(range, bits)` method can be used to check if the address falls into a<br>certain CIDR range.<br>Note that an address can be (obviously) matched only against an address of the same type.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:1234::1");<br>var range = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::");<br><br>addr.match(range, 32); // => true<br>```<br><br>Alternatively, `match` can also be called as `match([range, bits])`. In this way,<br>it can be used together with the `parseCIDR(string)` method, which parses an IP<br>address together with a CIDR range.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:1234::1");<br><br>addr.match(ipaddr.parseCIDR("2001:db8::/32")); // => true<br>```<br><br>A `range()` method returns one of predefined names for several special ranges defined<br>by IP protocols. The exact names (and their respective CIDR ranges) can be looked up<br>in the source: [IPv6 ranges] and [IPv4 ranges]. Some common ones include `"unicast"`<br>(the default one) and `"reserved"`.<br><br>You can match against your own range list by using<br>`ipaddr.subnetMatch(address, rangeList, defaultName)` method. It can work with a mix of IPv6 or IPv4 addresses, and accepts a name-to-subnet map as the range list. For example:<br><br>```js<br>var rangeList = {<br>  documentationOnly: [ ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::"), 32 ],<br>  tunnelProviders: [<br>    [ ipaddr.parse("2001:470::"), 32 ], // he.net<br>    [ ipaddr.parse("2001:5c0::"), 32 ]  // freenet6<br>  ]<br>};<br>ipaddr.subnetMatch(ipaddr.parse("2001:470:8:66::1"), rangeList, "unknown"); // => "tunnelProviders"<br>```<br><br>The addresses can be converted to their byte representation with `toByteArray()`.<br>(Actually, JavaScript mostly does not know about byte buffers. They are emulated with<br>arrays of numbers, each in range of 0..255.)<br><br>```js<br>var bytes = ipaddr.parse("2a00:1450:8007::68").toByteArray(); // ipv6.google.com<br>bytes // => [42, 0x00, 0x14, 0x50, 0x80, 0x07, 0x00, <zeroes...>, 0x00, 0x68 ]<br>```<br><br>The `ipaddr.IPv4` and `ipaddr.IPv6` objects have some methods defined, too. All of them<br>have the same interface for both protocols, and are similar to global methods.<br><br>`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` can be used to check if the string is a valid address<br>for particular protocol, and `ipaddr.IPvX.parse(string)` is the error-throwing parser.<br><br>`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` uses the same format for parsing as the POSIX `inet_ntoa` function, which accepts unusual formats like `0xc0.168.1.1` or `0x10000000`. The function `ipaddr.IPv4.isValidFourPartDecimal(string)` validates the IPv4 address and also ensures that it is written in four-part decimal format.<br><br>[IPv6 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L186<br>[IPv4 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L71<br><br>#### IPv6 properties<br><br>Sometimes you will want to convert IPv6 not to a compact string representation (with<br>the `::` substitution); the `toNormalizedString()` method will return an address where<br>all zeroes are explicit.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:0db8::0001");<br>addr.toString(); // => "2001:db8::1"<br>addr.toNormalizedString(); // => "2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1"<br>```<br><br>The `isIPv4MappedAddress()` method will return `true` if this address is an IPv4-mapped<br>one, and `toIPv4Address()` will return an IPv4 object address.<br><br>To access the underlying binary representation of the address, use `addr.parts`.<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:10::1234:DEAD");<br>addr.parts // => [0x2001, 0xdb8, 0x10, 0, 0, 0, 0x1234, 0xdead]<br>```<br><br>A IPv6 zone index can be accessed via `addr.zoneId`:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::%eth0");<br>addr.zoneId // => "eth0"<br>```<br><br>#### IPv4 properties<br><br>`toIPv4MappedAddress()` will return a corresponding IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.<br><br>To access the underlying representation of the address, use `addr.octets`.<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("192.168.1.1");<br>addr.octets // => [192, 168, 1, 1]<br>```<br><br>`prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()` will return a CIDR prefix length for a valid IPv4 netmask or<br>false if the netmask is not valid.<br><br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.parse("255.255.255.240").prefixLengthFromSubnetMask() == 28<br>ipaddr.IPv4.parse("255.192.164.0").prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()  == null<br>```<br><br>`subnetMaskFromPrefixLength()` will return an IPv4 netmask for a valid CIDR prefix length.<br><br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(24) == "255.255.255.0"<br>ipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(29) == "255.255.255.248"<br>```<br><br>`broadcastAddressFromCIDR()` will return the broadcast address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.<br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.broadcastAddressFromCIDR("172.0.0.1/24") == "172.0.0.255"<br>```<br>`networkAddressFromCIDR()` will return the network address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.<br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.networkAddressFromCIDR("172.0.0.1/24") == "172.0.0.0"<br>```<br><br>#### Conversion<br><br>IPv4 and IPv6 can be converted bidirectionally to and from network byte order (MSB) byte arrays.<br><br>The `fromByteArray()` method will take an array and create an appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 object<br>if the input satisfies the requirements. For IPv4 it has to be an array of four 8-bit values,<br>while for IPv6 it has to be an array of sixteen 8-bit values.<br><br>For example:<br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x7f, 0, 0, 1]);<br>addr.toString(); // => "127.0.0.1"<br>```<br><br>or<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])<br>addr.toString(); // => "2001:db8::1"<br>```<br><br>Both objects also offer a `toByteArray()` method, which returns an array in network byte order (MSB).<br><br>For example:<br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("127.0.0.1");<br>addr.toByteArray(); // => [0x7f, 0, 0, 1]<br>```<br><br>or<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::1");<br>addr.toByteArray(); // => [0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]<br>```<br><br>===== is-accessor-descriptor@0.1.6 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2015, Jon Schlinkert.<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>  For the developers" and authors" protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users" and<br>authors" sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.<br><br>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>protecting users" freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>  0. Definitions.<br><br>  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br><br>  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.<br><br>  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>  1. Source Code.<br><br>  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br><br>  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work"s<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>Source.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>same work.<br><br>  2. Basic Permissions.<br><br>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br>  3. Protecting Users" Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.<br><br>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work"s<br>users, your or third parties" legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures.<br><br>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program"s source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>    it, and giving a relevant date.<br><br>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>    "keep intact all notices".<br><br>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>    work need not make them do so.<br><br>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation"s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>in one of these ways:<br><br>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>    with subsection 6b.<br><br>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>    charge under subsection 6d.<br><br>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br>  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br>  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>modification has been made.<br><br>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).<br><br>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br>  7. Additional Terms.<br><br>  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>    authors of the material; or<br><br>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>    those licensors and authors.<br><br>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br>  8. Termination.<br><br>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.<br><br>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party"s predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br>  11. Patents.<br><br>  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor"s "contributor version".<br><br>  A contributor"s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.<br><br>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor"s essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br>  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.<br><br>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient"s use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.<br><br>  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br>  12. No Surrender of Others" Freedom.<br><br>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.<br><br>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy"s<br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.<br><br>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>===== kind-of@3.2.2 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014-2017, Jon Schlinkert<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Poppers?<br><br>A popper is an element on the screen which "pops out" from the natural flow of your application.  <br>Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.<br><br><br>## So, yet another tooltip library?<br><br>Well, basically, **no**.  <br>Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element<br>to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  <br><br>The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**<br>(similar to middlewares or plugins).  <br>The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).<br><br>Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  <br>It"s used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).<br><br>### Popper.js<br><br>This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to<br>the poppers.<br><br>Some of the key points are:<br><br>- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn"t mess with your DOM!);<br>- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;<br>- Supports Shadow DOM elements;<br>- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;<br><br>Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!<br><br>Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).<br><br><br>### Tooltip.js<br><br>Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,<br>we created **Tooltip.js**.  <br>It"s a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  <br>Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be<br>easy to integrate it in your projects.  <br>The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.<br><br>Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).<br><br><br>## Installation<br>Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:<br><br>| Source |                                                                                  |<br>|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br>| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |<br>| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |<br>| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |<br>| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |<br>| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |<br>| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |<br><br>Tooltip.js as well:<br><br>| Source |                                                                                  |<br>|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br>| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |<br>| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |<br>| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |<br>| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |<br>| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |<br><br>\*: Bower isn"t officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  <br>For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).<br><br>### Dist targets<br><br>Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.<br><br>- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;<br>- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;<br>- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;<br><br>Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.<br><br>## Usage<br><br>Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button<br><br>```js<br>var reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>var popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>var anotherPopper = new Popper(<br>    reference,<br>    popper,<br>    {<br>        // popper options here<br>    }<br>);<br>```<br><br>### Callbacks<br><br>Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after<br>the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.<br><br>```js<br>const reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>const popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>new Popper(reference, popper, {<br>    onCreate: (data) => {<br>        // data is an object containing all the informations computed<br>        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow<br>        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation<br>    },<br>    onUpdate: (data) => {<br>        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates<br>    }<br>});<br>```<br><br>### Writing your own modifiers<br><br>Popper.js is based on a "plugin-like" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated "modifiers".  <br>A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  <br><br>To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)<br><br><br>### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration<br><br>Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because<br>they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  <br>Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,<br>you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using<br>your library of choice.  <br><br>For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing<br>frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.<br><br>Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and<br>integrate Popper.js by yourself!<br><br>```js<br>function applyReactStyle(data) {<br>    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper<br>};<br><br>const reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>const popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>new Popper(reference, popper, {<br>    modifiers: {<br>        applyStyle: { enabled: false },<br>        applyReactStyle: {<br>            enabled: true,<br>            fn: applyReactStyle,<br>            order: 800,<br>        },<br>    },<br>});<br><br>```<br><br>### Migration from Popper.js v0<br><br>Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to<br>Popper.js v1.  <br><br>https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62<br><br>Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.<br><br>### Performances<br><br>Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper"s position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  <br>This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.<br><br>## Notes<br><br>### Libraries using Popper.js<br><br>The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to<br>be used in 3rd party libraries.  <br><br>Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.<br><br><br>### Credits<br>I want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:<br><br>- [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development;<br>- [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library;<br>- [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library;<br>- [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world;<br>- [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports;<br>- **you** for the star you"ll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try ??<br><br>### Copyright and license<br>Code and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

If your code relies on<br>classList in any way, you want to use a polyfill like<br>[dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4).<br><br>This HOC supports stateless components as of v5.7.0, and switched to using<br>transpiled es6 classes rather than `createClass` as of v6.<br><br>## Sections covered in this README<br><br>* [Installation](#installation)<br>* [Usage:](#usage)<br>  * [ES6 Class Component](#es6-class-component)<br>  * [Functional Component with UseState Hook](#functional-component-with-usestate-hook)<br>  * [CommonJS Require](#commonjs-require)<br>* [Ensuring there"s a click handler](#ensuring-there-is-a-click-handler)<br>* [Regulate which events to listen for](#regulate-which-events-to-listen-for)<br>* [Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks](#regulate-whether-or-not-to-listen-for-outside-clicks)<br>* [Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks](#regulate-whether-or-not-to-listen-to-scrollbar-clicks)<br>* [Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`](#regulating-evtpreventdefault-and-evtstoppropagation)<br>* [Marking elements as "skip over this one" during the event loop](#marking-elements-as-skip-over-this-one-during-the-event-loop)<br>* [Older React code: "What happened to the Mixin??"](#older-react-code-what-happened-to-the-mixin)<br>  * [But how can I access my component?

You then use it in your components<br>as:<br><br><br>## Usage<br><br>### ES6 Class Component<br><br>```js<br>import React, { Component } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  handleClickOutside = evt => {<br>    // ..handling code goes here...<br>  };<br>}<br><br>export default onClickOutside(MyComponent);<br>```<br><br>### Functional Component with UseState Hook<br><br>```js<br>import React, { useState } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>const Menu = () => {<br>  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);<br>  const toggle = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);<br>  Menu.handleClickOutside = () => setIsOpen(false);<br>  return (<br>      //...<br>  )<br>};<br><br>const clickOutsideConfig = {<br>  handleClickOutside: () => Menu.handleClickOutside<br>};<br><br>export default onClickOutside(Menu, clickOutsideConfig);<br>```<br><br>Example: https://codesandbox.io/s/vn66kq7mml<br><br><br>### CommonJS Require<br><br>```js<br>// .default is needed because library is bundled as ES6 module<br>var onClickOutside = require("react-onclickoutside").default;<br>var createReactClass = require("create-react-class");<br><br>// create a new component, wrapped by this onclickoutside HOC:<br>var MyComponent = onClickOutside(<br>  createReactClass({<br>    // ...,<br>    handleClickOutside: function(evt) {<br>      // ...handling code goes here...<br>    }<br>    // ...<br>  })<br>);<br>```<br><br>### Ensuring there is a click handler<br><br>Note that if you try to wrap a React component class without a<br>`handleClickOutside(evt)` handler like this, the HOC will throw an error. In<br>order to use a custom event handler, you can specify the function to be used by<br>the HOC as second parameter (this can be useful in environments like TypeScript,<br>where the fact that the wrapped component does not implement the handler can be<br>flagged at compile-time):<br><br>```js<br>// load the HOC:<br>import React, { Component } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>// create a new component, wrapped below by onClickOutside HOC:<br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  // ...<br>  myClickOutsideHandler(evt) {<br>    // ...handling code goes here...<br>  }<br>  // ...<br>}<br>var clickOutsideConfig = {<br>  handleClickOutside: function(instance) {<br>    return instance.myClickOutsideHandler;<br>  }<br>};<br>var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);<br>```<br><br>Note that if you try to wrap a React component with a custom handler that the<br>component does not implement, the HOC will throw an error at run-time.<br><br>## Regulate which events to listen for<br><br>By default, "outside clicks" are based on both `mousedown` and `touchstart`<br>events; if that is what you need, then you do not need to specify anything<br>special. However, if you need different events, you can specify these using the<br>`eventTypes` property. If you just need one event, you can pass in the event<br>name as plain string:<br><br>```js<br><MyComponent eventTypes="click" ... /><br>```<br><br>For multiple events, you can pass in the array of event names you need to listen<br>for:<br><br>```js<br><MyComponent eventTypes={["click", "touchend"]} ... /><br>```<br><br>## Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks<br><br>Wrapped components have two functions that can be used to explicitly listen for,<br>or do nothing with, outside clicks<br><br>* `enableOnClickOutside()` - Enables outside click listening by setting up the<br>  event listening bindings.<br>* `disableOnClickOutside()` - Disables outside click listening by explicitly<br>  removing the event listening bindings.<br><br>In addition, you can create a component that uses this HOC such that it has the<br>code set up and ready to go, but not listening for outside click events until<br>you explicitly issue its `enableOnClickOutside()`, by passing in a properly<br>called `disableOnClickOutside`:<br><br>```js<br>import React, { Component } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  // ...<br>  handleClickOutside(evt) {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>  // ...<br>}<br>var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);<br><br>class Container extends Component {<br>  render(evt) {<br>    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} />;<br>  }<br>}<br>```<br><br>Using `disableOnClickOutside()` or `enableOnClickOutside()` within<br>`componentDidMount` or `componentWillMount` is considered an anti-pattern, and<br>does not have consistent behaviour when using the mixin and HOC/ES7 Decorator.<br>Favour setting the `disableOnClickOutside` property on the component.<br><br>## Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks<br><br>By default this HOC will listen for "clicks inside the document", which may<br>include clicks that occur on the scrollbar. Quite often clicking on the<br>scrollbar _should_ close whatever is open but in case your project invalidates<br>that assumption you can use the `excludeScrollbar` property to explicitly tell<br>the HOC that clicks on the scrollbar should be ignored:<br><br>```js<br>import React, { Component } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  // ...<br>}<br>var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);<br><br>class Container extends Component {<br>  render(evt) {<br>    return <EnhancedComponent excludeScrollbar={true} />;<br>  }<br>}<br>```<br><br>Alternatively, you can specify this behavior as default for all instances of<br>your component passing a configuration object as second parameter:<br><br>```js<br>import React, { Component } from "react";<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside";<br><br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  // ...<br>}<br>var clickOutsideConfig = {<br>  excludeScrollbar: true<br>};<br>var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);<br>```<br><br>## Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`<br><br>Technically this HOC lets you pass in `preventDefault={true/false}` and<br>`stopPropagation={true/false}` to regulate what happens to the event when it<br>hits your `handleClickOutside(evt)` function, but beware: `stopPropagation` may<br>not do what you expect it to do.<br><br>Each component adds new event listeners to the document, which may or may not<br>cause as many event triggers as there are event listening bindings. In the test<br>file found in `./test/browser/index.html`, the coded uses<br>`stopPropagation={true}` but sibling events still make it to "parents".<br><br>## Marking elements as "skip over this one" during the event loop<br><br>If you want the HOC to ignore certain elements, you can tell the HOC which CSS<br>class name it should use for this purposes. If you want explicit control over<br>the class name, use `outsideClickIgnoreClass={some string}` as component<br>property, or if you don"t, the default string used is<br>`ignore-react-onclickoutside`.<br><br>## Older React code: "What happened to the Mixin??"<br><br>Due to ES2015/ES6 `class` syntax making mixins essentially impossible, and the<br>fact that HOC wrapping works perfectly fine in ES5 and older versions of React,<br>as of this package"s version 5.0.0 no Mixin is offered anymore.<br><br>If you _absolutely_ need a mixin... you really don"t.<br><br>### But how can I access my component? It has an API that I rely on!<br><br>No, I get that. I constantly have that problem myself, so while there is no<br>universal agreement on how to do that, this HOC offers a `getInstance()`<br>function that you can call for a reference to the component you wrapped, so that<br>you can call its API without headaches:<br><br>```js<br>import React, { Component } from "react"<br>import onClickOutside from "react-onclickoutside"<br><br>class MyComponent extends Component {<br>  // ...<br>  handleClickOutside(evt) {<br>    // ...<br>  }<br>  ...<br>}<br>var EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);<br><br>class Container extends Component {<br>  constructor(props) {<br>    super(props);<br>    this.getMyComponentRef = this.getMyComponentRef.bind(this);<br>  }<br><br>  someFunction() {<br>    var ref = this.myComponentRef;<br>    // 1) Get the wrapped component instance:<br>    var superTrueMyComponent = ref.getInstance();<br>    // and call instance functions defined for it:<br>    superTrueMyComponent.customFunction();<br>  }<br><br>  getMyComponentRef(ref) {<br>    this.myComponentRef = ref;<br>  }<br><br>  render(evt) {<br>    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} ref={this.getMyComponentRef}/><br>  }<br>}<br>```<br><br>Note that there is also a `getClass()` function, to get the original Class that<br>was passed into the HOC wrapper, but if you find yourself needing this you"re<br>probably doing something wrong: you really want to define your classes as real,<br>require"able etc. units, and then write wrapped components separately, so that<br>you can always access the original class"s `statics` etc. properties without<br>needing to extract them out of a HOC.<br><br>## Which version do I need for which version of React?<br><br>If you use **React 0.12 or 0.13**, **version 2.4 and below** will work.<br><br>If you use **React 0.14**, use **v2.5 through v4.9**, as these specifically use<br>`react-DOM` for the necessary DOM event bindings.<br><br>If you use **React 15**, you can use **v4.x, which offers both a mixin and HOC,<br>or use v5.x, which is HOC-only**.<br><br>If you use **React 15.5**, you can use **v5.11.x**, which relies on<br>`createClass` as supplied by `create-react-class` rather than<br>`React.createClass`.<br><br>If you use **React 16** or 15.5 in preparation of 16, use v6.x, which uses pure<br>class notation.<br><br>### Support-wise, only the latest version will receive updates and bug fixes.<br><br>I do not believe in perpetual support for outdated libraries, so if you find one<br>of the older versions is not playing nice with an even older React: you know<br>what to do, and it"s not "keep using that old version of React".<br><br>## IE does not support classList for SVG elements!<br><br>This is true, but also an edge-case problem that only exists for IE11 (as all<br>versions prior to 11 [no longer exist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17454/lifecycle-faq-internet-explorer)), and should be addressed by you, rather<br>than by thousands of individual libraries that assume browsers have proper<br>HTML API  implementations (IE Edge has proper `classList` support even for SVG).<br><br>If you need this to work, you can add a shim for `classList` to your page(s),<br>loaded before you load your React code, and you"ll have instantly fixed _every_<br>library that you might remotely rely on that makes use of the `classList`<br>property. You can find several shims quite easily, a good one to start with is<br>the [dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4) shim, which adds all manner of<br>good DOM4 properties to "not quite at DOM4 yet" browser implementations.<br><br>Eventually this problem will stop being one, but in the mean time _you_ are<br>responsible for making _your_ site work by shimming everything that needs<br>shimming for IE. As such, **if you file a PR to fix classList-and-SVG issues<br>specifically for this library, your PR will be closed and I will politely point<br>you to this README.md section**. I will not accept PRs to fix this issue. You<br>already have the power to fix it, and I expect you to take responsibility as a<br>fellow developer to shim what you need instead of getting obsolete quirks<br>supported by libraries whose job isn"t to support obsolete quirks.<br><br>To work around the issue you can use this simple shim:<br><br>```js<br>if (!("classList" in SVGElement.prototype)) {<br>  Object.defineProperty(SVGElement.prototype, "classList", {<br>    get() {<br>      return {<br>        contains: className => {<br>          return this.className.baseVal.split(" ").indexOf(className) !== -1;<br>        }<br>      };<br>    }<br>  });<br>}<br>```<br><br>## I can"t find what I need in the README<br><br>If you"ve read the whole thing and you still can"t find what you were looking<br>for, then the README is missing important information that should be added in.<br>Please [file an issue](https://github.com/Pomax/react-onclickoutside/issues) with a request for additional documentation,<br>describing what you were hoping to find in enough detail that it can be used to<br>write up the information you needed.<br><br>===== react-popper@1.3.7 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2018 React Popper authors<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all<br>copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.<br><br>- *transports*<br><br>```js<br>["websocket", "flashsocket", "htmlfile", "xhr-multipart", "xhr-polling", "jsonp-polling"]<br>```<br><br>  A list of the transports to attempt to utilize (in order of preference).<br><br>- *"connect timeout"*<br><br>```js<br>5000<br>```<br><br>  The amount of milliseconds a transport has to create a connection before we consider it timed out.<br>  <br>- *"try multiple transports"*<br><br>```js<br>true<br>```<br><br>  A boolean indicating if we should try other transports when the  connectTimeout occurs.<br>  <br>- *reconnect*<br><br>```js<br>true<br>```<br><br>  A boolean indicating if we should automatically reconnect if a connection is disconnected. <br>  <br>- *"reconnection delay"*<br><br>```js<br>500<br>```<br><br>  The amount of milliseconds before we try to connect to the server again. We are using a exponential back off algorithm for the following reconnections, on each reconnect attempt this value will get multiplied (500 > 1000 > 2000 > 4000 > 8000).<br>  <br><br>- *"max reconnection attempts"*<br><br>```js<br>10<br>```<br><br>  The amount of attempts should we make using the current transport to connect to the server? After this we will do one final attempt, and re-try with all enabled transport methods before we give up.<br><br>##### Properties:<br><br>- *options*<br><br>  The passed in options combined with the defaults.<br><br>- *connected*<br><br>  Whether the socket is connected or not.<br>  <br>- *connecting*<br><br>  Whether the socket is connecting or not.<br><br>- *reconnecting*<br><br>  Whether we are reconnecting or not.<br>  <br>- *transport*  <br><br>  The transport instance.<br><br>##### Methods:<br>  <br>- *connect(?)*<br><br>  Establishes a connection. If ? is supplied as argument, it will be called once the connection is established.<br>  <br>- *send(message)*<br>  <br>  A string of data to send.<br>  <br>- *disconnect*<br><br>  Closes the connection.<br>  <br>- *on(event, ?)*<br><br>  Adds a listener for the event *event*.<br><br>- *once(event, ?)*<br><br>  Adds a one time listener for the event *event*. The listener is removed after the first time the event is fired.<br>  <br>- *removeListener(event, ?)*<br><br>  Removes the listener ? for the event *event*.<br>  <br>##### Events:<br><br>- *connect*<br><br>  Fired when the connection is established and the handshake successful.<br>  <br>- *connecting(transport_type)*<br><br>    Fired when a connection is attempted, passing the transport name.<br>  <br>- *connect_failed*<br><br>    Fired when the connection timeout occurs after the last connection attempt.<br>  This only fires if the `connectTimeout` option is set.<br>  If the `tryTransportsOnConnectTimeout` option is set, this only fires once all<br>  possible transports have been tried.<br>  <br>- *message(message)*<br>  <br>  Fired when a message arrives from the server<br><br>- *close*<br><br>  Fired when the connection is closed. Be careful with using this event, as some transports will fire it even under temporary, expected disconnections (such as XHR-Polling).<br>  <br>- *disconnect*<br><br>  Fired when the connection is considered disconnected.<br>  <br>- *reconnect(transport_type,reconnectionAttempts)*<br><br>  Fired when the connection has been re-established. This only fires if the `reconnect` option is set.<br><br>- *reconnecting(reconnectionDelay,reconnectionAttempts)*<br><br>  Fired when a reconnection is attempted, passing the next delay for the next reconnection.<br><br>- *reconnect_failed*<br><br>  Fired when all reconnection attempts have failed and we where unsuccessful in reconnecting to the server.  <br><br>### Contributors<br><br>Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt;<br><br>Arnout Kazemier &lt;info@3rd-eden.com&gt;<br><br>### License <br><br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br>"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br>without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br>distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br>permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br>the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY<br>CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,<br>TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE<br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br>===== source-map-resolve@0.5.2 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Simon Lydell<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.<br><br>The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.<br><br>### Breaking changes from 2.x<br><br>URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.<br><br>### Breaking changes from 1.x<br><br>The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.<br><br>## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))<br><br>Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

See http://einaros.github.com/ws for the full reports.<br><br>Comes with a command line utility, `wscat`, which can either act as a server (--listen), or client (--connect); Use it to debug simple websocket services.<br><br>## Protocol support ##<br><br>* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera. Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the `disableHixie` option to true.)<br>* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`, or argument `-p 8` for wscat)<br>* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`, or argument `-p 13` for wscat)<br><br>_See the echo.websocket.org example below for how to use the `protocolVersion` option._<br><br>## Usage ##<br><br>### Installing ###<br><br>`npm install ws`<br><br>### Sending and receiving text data ###<br><br>```js<br>var WebSocket = require("ws");<br>var ws = new WebSocket("ws://www.host.com/path");<br>ws.on("open", function() {<br>    ws.send("something");<br>});<br>ws.on("message", function(data, flags) {<br>    // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received<br>    // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked<br>});<br>```<br><br>### Sending binary data ###<br><br>```js<br>var WebSocket = require("ws");<br>var ws = new WebSocket("ws://www.host.com/path");<br>ws.on("open", function() {<br>    var array = new Float32Array(5);<br>    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) array[i] = i / 2;<br>    ws.send(array, {binary: true, mask: true});<br>});<br>```<br><br>Setting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the websocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.<br><br>### Server example ###<br><br>```js<br>var WebSocketServer = require("ws").Server<br>  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});<br>wss.on("connection", function(ws) {<br>    ws.on("message", function(message) {<br>        console.log("received: %s", message);<br>    });<br>    ws.send("something");<br>});<br>```<br><br>### Server sending broadcast data ###<br><br>```js<br>var WebSocketServer = require("ws").Server<br>  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});<br>  <br>wss.broadcast = function(data) {<br>	for(var i in this.clients)<br>		this.clients[i].send(data);<br>};<br>```<br><br>### Error handling best practices ###<br><br>```js<br>// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted<br>ws.send("something");<br><br>// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional callback.<br>// The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has actually been sent.<br>ws.send("something", function(error) {<br>    // if error is null, the send has been completed,<br>    // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.<br>});<br><br>// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note**<br>// that since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not*<br>// be captured when this technique is used.<br>try {<br>    ws.send("something");<br>}<br>catch (e) {<br>    // handle error<br>}<br>```<br><br>### echo.websocket.org demo ###<br><br>```js<br>var WebSocket = require("ws");<br>var ws = new WebSocket("ws://echo.websocket.org/", {protocolVersion: 8, origin: "http://websocket.org"});<br>ws.on("open", function() {<br>    console.log("connected");<br>    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});<br>});<br>ws.on("close", function() {<br>    console.log("disconnected");<br>});<br>ws.on("message", function(data, flags) {<br>    console.log("Roundtrip time: " + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + "ms", flags);<br>    setTimeout(function() {<br>        ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});<br>    }, 500);<br>});<br>```<br><br>### wscat against echo.websocket.org ###<br><br>    $ npm install -g ws<br>    $ wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org <br>    connected (press CTRL+C to quit)<br>    > hi there<br>    < hi there<br>    > are you a happy parrot?<br>    < are you a happy parrot?<br><br>### Other examples ###<br><br>For a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.<br><br>Note that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.<br><br>Otherwise, see the test cases.<br><br>### Running the tests ###<br><br>`make test`<br><br>## API Docs ##<br><br>See the doc/ directory for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.<br><br>## License ##<br><br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br>"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br>without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br>distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br>permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br>the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY<br>CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,<br>TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE<br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br>===== xmlcreate@2.0.1 =====<br>Apache License<br>==============<br><br>_Version 2.0, January 2004_  <br>_&lt;<http://www.apache.org/licenses/>&gt;_<br><br>### Terms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution<br><br>#### 1.
